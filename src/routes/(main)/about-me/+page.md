## Hi ðŸ‘‹ my name is Jeff Ng

### Who am I

I am a person still trying to craft myself and work towards a better self. At work, I am mostly a frontend developer, currently still learning more about backends. Off work, I love gaming (pushed me to learn coding), exercising, and hanging out with my friends.

### I code and create

I love coding so much, even though the process of making this blog is a gruesome one, I still enjoyed it a lot, it's because I made it myself! I also have no trouble working on old code because some parts of this site is taken from past attempts (I did improve them to fit what I want though).

### I love learning

Currently learning how to draw, speak Japanese, and care for myself more. I strongly think that we should spend our time building multiple aspects of our lives (knowledge, health, skills to name a few), that way even when time passes, we do not stagnate. A lot of people are afraid of starting to learn, because of the steep difficulty curve at the beginning, but if we don't start, time will still pass anyways, and we didn't learn from it. I try to learn a bunch of things at once, so when I get tired of one, I can quickly swap what I learn.

### Enjoy your stay

I hope you enjoy your stay here, whether you are employers, my friends or just some stranger who stumbled upon my site. Do check the [home page](/) & the [blog](/blog) if you can!
